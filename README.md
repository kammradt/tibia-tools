## Description 📝

**Tibia Tools** is a study project aiming to create useful and fun stuff for tibia players while I try to improve my skills at software development.   

> [Tibia]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_(video_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_(video_game))) is a 1997 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CipSoft. It is one of the earliest and longest-running MMORPGs, with a popularity that peaked in 2007.

 
## Goal 🗺️
> :construction: In progress

### Web app
The content and features will probably be displayed using a website. I don't actually know how I will build it, but maybe I'll try some new Javascript framework such as Vue.js or React.  

### API
Be able to save user information is part of the customization wanted, so I imagine this being possible with an Api using something like Nest.js or another similar.
I don't know exactly when, but maybe I also	want to send notifications and have jobs running, so this can be the place (?)

### Microservices
This is a unknown place for me that sounds interesting. I really wanted some public APIs for tibia but have not found much. Maybe will be interesting to make all feature available in public endpoints, so I can call them from my API and also provide them without the need of registration through the API.


### Features :tada:
> :construction: In progress

-  [ ]  **Users**
    -  [ ] Account creation

-  [ ]  **Features**
    -  [ ] Coins Converter
    > Money is measured using coins and they have multiple types with different values. Manipulating and converting them will be useful.
     
    -  [ ] Damage Resume
    > Character inflict damage through attacks, so having some detailed information from logs about it would be cool. (Mean, Max, Min, etc)
     
    -  [ ] Mining Resume
    > There is a mining system that allow players to gather resources. Statistics and a projection of results would be cool to understand how is the progress going.
    
    -  [ ] Task Projection
    > Players can complete tasks by killing monsters. Based on logs, we can estimate the time necessary to complete a certain task.

    -  [ ] Backpack Information
    > Backpacks are used to carry itens, and there is a common practice to have multiple backpacks inside each other. Would be nice to know how much backpacks and slots you have based on a single one and it's weight.

    -  [ ] Loot Manager
    > Monsters can have loot inside it when killed. Based on IDs, we can easily create structured looting lists for a better organization. (Based on [this](http://www.zottesso.com.br/tibia))  

    -  [ ] Market Notifications
    > There is a market where player can sell and buy itens. Based on a wishlist, we can scrape this data from a website and send notifications to users that want a specific item.
