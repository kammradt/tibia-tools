## Description 📝

**Tibia Tools** is a study project aiming to create useful and fun stuff for tibia players while I try to improve my skills at software development.   

> [Tibia]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_(video_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_(video_game))) is a 1997 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CipSoft. It is one of the earliest and longest-running MMORPGs, with a popularity that peaked in 2007.

 
## Goal 🗺️
> :construction: In progress

### Web app
The content and features will probably be displayed using a website. I don't actually know how I will build it, but maybe I'll try some new Javascript framework such as Vue.js or React.  

### API
Be able to save user information is part of the customization wanted, so I imagine this being possible with an Api using something like Nest.js or another similar.
I don't know exactly when, but maybe I also	want to send notifications and have jobs running, so this can be the place (?)

### Microservices
This is a unknown place for me that sounds interesting. I really wanted some public APIs for tibia but have not found much. Maybe will be interesting to make all feature available in public endpoints, so I can call them from my API and also provide them without the need of registration through the API.
